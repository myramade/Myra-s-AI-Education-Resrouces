# Learn AI 
With the explosion of Generative AI, the interest in AI education is exploding, but where do you start? Well if you are faculty at a community college or university, you should check out [AWS Machine Learning University Educator Enablement Program](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/educators/). But if you are just looking for additional AI education resources, I've compiled a list of resources below. Some of the resources are open-source and free to use, while others may charge a fee for use or actual tuition. I do my best to find all the highest quality free resources, so be sure to follow this repo by clicking the star at the top. I've organized this list in a pathway format, beginning with the core knowledge you should have in order to set yourself up for success.

## Learn LLM
Course | Description | Cost 
---|---|---|
[LLMops](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/llmops/) | In this course, you’ll go through the LLMOps pipeline of pre-processing training data for supervised instruction tuning, and adapt a supervised tuning pipeline to train and deploy a custom LLM. This is useful in creating an LLM workflow for your specific application. For example, creating a question-answer chatbot tailored to answer Python coding questions, which you’ll do in this course. | Free
[Fine Tuning a Large Language Model (LLM)](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/finetuning-large-language-models/) | With finetuning, you’re able to take your own data to train the model on it, and update the weights of the neural nets in the LLM, changing the model compared to other methods like prompt engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation. Finetuning allows the model to learn style, form, and can update the model with new knowledge to improve results | Free
[LangChain for Application Development](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-for-llm-application-development/) | This one-hour course, instructed by the creator of LangChain Harrison Chase as well as Andrew Ng will vastly expand the possibilities for leveraging powerful language models, where you can now create incredibly robust applications in a matter of hours | Free
